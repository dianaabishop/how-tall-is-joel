### Overview
This is a website I built for myself using Flask and React.

### Run the Website Locally
1. Make sure that you are in the directory with the `app.py` file (you can determine this by typing `ls -l` into the command line to list the files your current directory
and ensuring that you see `app.py` there)
2. Install node packages through `npm install`
3. Install flask through requirements.txt file, `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. In one terminal, run `npm run start`. This will build and start the React web app.
5. In a second terminal, run `flask run --reload --debugger`. This will run the Flask app on an HTTP server. 
3. You will see a log pop up in the console indicating that your application is `* Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/` 
4. To view your webapp, click on `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` to open it in a new tab, or preview in the sidebar.

### That's it! ðŸŽ‰
